Baseline Model - Quick Guide
This version of the EDES model is the so called Baseline Model, basically this uses either the CGM or OGTT model estimates as the calibrated parameters which can them be 
compared against one another as the complex meal data is added to compare their fit etc.This is a stripped-down version of the original glucose-insulin model, mainly for
validating OGTT fits against complex meal data.

Main Changes

Filters matching IDs between OGTT & complex meal data
Added specific complex meal validation
New metrics for checking model performance
Saves results in separate files for OGTT vs complex meals

New Files
baseline_fit_short2.jl  - Main script
test_robustness2.jl    - Complex meal validation
func_copy.jl           - Core model (modified from func.jl)

Key Differences from Original

Data handling:

Uses HFMMdata_filtered.csv instead of real_data.csv
Filters for matching IDs automatically
Separate handling for OGTT vs complex meals


Added metrics:

Time in Range (TIR)
Peak & time-to-peak
AUC (Area Under Curve)
R-squared for fits


Output:

ComplexMealSimulates_OGTT.csv
ComplexMealResiduals_OGTT.csv
ComplexMealMetrics.csv
Individual plots with confidence bands
