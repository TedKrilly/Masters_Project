The original EDES model is defined in the fit_model.jl and func.jl files. The data.csv is the sample data file that Erdos provided and whose data format I replicated when 
compiling the relevant data to reduce unnessesary alterations. The folder EDES-Model then proceeds with the model variants implemented during the course of this project. 

The various folders represent the different model variations of the EDES-Model employed, such as the no-insulin variant, baseline variant, and two-parameter model variant.
