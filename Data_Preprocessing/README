This folder contains the code related to the preprocessing of the data. This preprocessing was identification of the relevant 

Collection of Python scripts for processing different types of clinical glucose tests:

Raw Data Processors:
CGM_meal_data_locator3: Processes raw CGM data with OGTT timing
HFMM_meal_data_locator3: Processes raw CGM data with HFMM timing


Excel Data Processors:
Combined_Data_Processor: Processes OGTT glucose, insulin, and CGM data
HFMM_meal_processor: Processes HFMM plasma glucose and insulin data


Each script standardizes participant IDs, handles time windows appropriately, and includes data validation. 
Output format is consistent across all processors for easy integration into analysis pipelines.
