# Masters_Project
All the files associated with my Masters_Project being variations of the EDES model and/or processes conducted during the course of the running of my project. The original EDES model is defined in the fit_model.jl and func.jl files. The data.csv is the sample data file that Erdos provided and whose data format I replicated when compiling the relevant data to reduce unnessesary alterations. The folder EDES-Model then proceeds with the model variants implemented during the course of this project.
